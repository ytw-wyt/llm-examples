    - **Reason:** Encourages creative thinking and reflection.

2. **Selected-response Question (Assessment of Understanding):**
    - **Question:** Choose the most effective way to explain to Emma why we use the "invert and multiply" method for dividing fractions.
    - **Options:**
        - **A.** "Because that's the rule you need to follow."
        - **B.** "Imagine you have 7/4 of a pizza, and you want to divide it into pieces that are each 1/2 of a pizza. How many pieces do you get?"
        - **C.** "Think of it as a trick to make the problem easier."
        - **D.** "You need to do that to make the fractions simpler."
    - **Correct Answer:** **B.** "Imagine you have 7/4 of a pizza, and you want to divide it into pieces that are each 1/2 of a pizza. How many pieces do you get?"
    - **Explanation:** This option uses a real-world example that makes the concept more relatable and easier to understand. Option A is too vague, C simplifies the method without explanation, and D does not address the underlying concept.

3. **Constructed-response Open-Ended Question (Justification):**

**Research says…**  
Teachers often struggle to create meaningful story problems that accurately represent mathematical concepts. For instance, 8% of teachers were unable to create a story problem, and one teacher provided an incorrect story problem (representing 1/2 instead of 3/4). This highlights the need for better training in generating conceptual representations (Research Paper, 2023). 

**Research says…**  
Chinese teachers used three different models to represent division: measurement (or quotitive), partitive, and product and factors. These models help in explaining complex concepts in simpler terms. For example, 3/4 ÷ 1/2 can be illustrated as "How many 1/2s are there in 3/4?" or "If a rectangle has an area of 3/4 square feet and one side is 1/2 feet, how long is the other side?" (Research Paper, 2023).

**Research says…**  
Connecting mathematical concepts to real-world scenarios can make the subject more relatable and easier for students to understand. However, the real world alone cannot generate mathematical content. A solid understanding of the subject matter is essential for creating accurate representations. This is supported by the fact that most U.S. teachers struggled to illustrate the concept of division by fractions correctly, unlike their Chinese counterparts (Research Paper, 2023).

|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Use Real-World Scenarios        | Connect math problems to real-world situations to make them more relatable. | "If a team constructs 1/2 km of road each day, how many days will it take to construct a 3/4 km road?"            | "If you have 3/4 of a cake and you eat 1/2 of it, how much is left?" (This does not correctly represent division) |
| Visual Representations          | Use visual aids like diagrams and models to explain concepts.               | "Draw a rectangle with an area of 3/4 sq ft and one side as 1/2 ft. Find the length of the other side."           | "Just imagine the numbers in your head and divide." (This lacks visual aid and may confuse the student)           |
| Conceptual Understanding        | Focus on the underlying concepts rather than just procedures.               | "Explain why dividing 3/4 by 1/2 is the same as finding how many 1/2s fit into 3/4."                              | "Just remember the rule: flip the second fraction and multiply." (This doesn't explain the concept)               |
